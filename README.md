# ecomerce-challenge

## Description

This project builds a back end for an example e-commerce site. It provides routes, databases, and models that work together to document inventory items, and allows creating, deleting, or updating those items.

## Installation

you will need node project manager (npm) in order to install express. Do so by typing npm -i into the command line interface (cli). You will also need to use MySQL to log in, and then you will need to seed the databases with "node seeds/index.js" command.

## Usage

There is a walk through video of this project at [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NRcmPtwqxtw6DUQ1BslOekp5wESr4Quv/view). Once you have npm installed and seeded the SQL database, you can use insomnia to perform get, post, put, and delete requests in any of the given categories.
